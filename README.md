# CodeIgniter 4 Tasks

A task scheduler for CodeIgniter 4. 

**NOTE: Just starting development. Not for active consumption or it WILL make your app sick.**

My "to-do list" for this module: 

- provides commands to view when tasks are scheduled to run. Can list all for this week, or on a specific day.
- command to run any job manually
- command to disable/enable a job
- should have a variety of ways to notify when done, like logging, email, etc
- must be able to call shell commands
- must be able to run closures
- must be able to run commands
- restrict by environment
- can specify the timezone
- should collect performance information (in writeable as csv)
- command to view performance (https://github.com/codestudiohq/laravel-totem)
- provide a debug toolbar pane
